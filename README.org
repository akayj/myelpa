* MyELPA Mirror
This is an *ELPA* (*E*macs *L*isp *P*ackage *A*rchive) packages archive repo, but not all packages could be found here.
Currently used by myself, maybe *risky* for you, because some of these packages
are not the latest version.

** How to use
Put following line in your =init.el= file.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq package-archives '(("myelpa-local" . "~/myelpa")))
#+END_SRC
